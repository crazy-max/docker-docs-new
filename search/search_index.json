Variable Type Content pretty function ( var_list, rows, header, e ) Default mkdocs_macro Prettify a dictionary or object (used for environment documentation, or debugging). Builtin Jinja2 Filters \u00b6 These filters are provided by Jinja2 as a standard. See also the Jinja2 documentation on builtin filters ). Variable Type Content abs builtin_function_or_method Return the absolute value of the argument. attr function ( environment, obj, name, value ) Get an attribute of an object. foo|attr(\"bar\") works like foo.bar just that always an attribute is returned and items are not looked up. batch function ( value, linecount, fill_with, tmp, item ) A filter that batches items. It works pretty much like slice just the other way round. It returns a list of lists with the given number of items. If you provide a second parameter this is used to fill up missing items. See this example. capitalize function ( s ) Capitalize a value. The first character will be uppercase, all others lowercase. center function ( value, width ) Centers the value in a field of a given width. count builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. d function ( value, default_value, boolean ) If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value, otherwise the value of the variable. default function ( value, default_value, boolean ) If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value, otherwise the value of the variable. dictsort function ( value, case_sensitive, by, reverse, sort_func ) Sort a dict and yield (key, value) pairs. Python dicts may not be in the order you want to display them in, so sort them first. e builtin_function_or_method Replace the characters & , < , > , ' , and \" in the string with HTML-safe sequences. Use this if you need to display text that might contain such characters in HTML. escape builtin_function_or_method Replace the characters & , < , > , ' , and \" in the string with HTML-safe sequences. Use this if you need to display text that might contain such characters in HTML. filesizeformat function ( value, binary, bytes, base, prefixes, i, prefix, unit ) Format the value like a 'human-readable' file size (i.e. 13 kB, 4.1 MB, 102 Bytes, etc). Per default decimal prefixes are used (Mega, Giga, etc.), if the second parameter is set to True the binary prefixes are used (Mebi, Gibi). first function ( args, kwargs, b ) Return the first item of a sequence. float function ( value, default ) Convert the value into a floating point number. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0.0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. forceescape function ( value ) Enforce HTML escaping. This will probably double escape variables. format function ( value, args, kwargs ) Apply the given values to a printf-style _ format string, like string % values . groupby function ( args, kwargs, b ) Group a sequence of objects by an attribute using Python's :func: itertools.groupby . The attribute can use dot notation for nested access, like \"address.city\" . Unlike Python's groupby , the values are sorted first so only one group is returned for each unique value. indent function ( s, width, first, blank, newline, rv, lines ) Return a copy of the string with each line indented by 4 spaces. The first line and blank lines are not indented by default. int function ( value, default, base ) Convert the value into an integer. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. You can also override the default base (10) in the second parameter, which handles input with prefixes such as 0b, 0o and 0x for bases 2, 8 and 16 respectively. The base is ignored for decimal numbers and non-string values. join function ( args, kwargs, b ) Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the sequence. The separator between elements is an empty string per default, you can define it with the optional parameter. last function ( environment, seq ) Return the last item of a sequence. length builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. list function ( args, kwargs, b ) Convert the value into a list. If it was a string the returned list will be a list of characters. lower function ( s ) Convert a value to lowercase. map function ( args, kwargs, b ) Applies a filter on a sequence of objects or looks up an attribute. This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really only interested in a certain value of it. min function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the smallest item from the sequence. max function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the largest item from the sequence. pprint function ( value ) Pretty print a variable. Useful for debugging. random function ( context, seq ) Return a random item from the sequence. reject function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. rejectattr function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. replace function ( eval_ctx, s, old, new, count ) Return a copy of the value with all occurrences of a substring replaced with a new one. The first argument is the substring that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string. If the optional third argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. reverse function ( value, rv ) Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other way round. round function ( value, precision, method, func ) Round the number to a given precision. The first parameter specifies the precision (default is 0 ), the second the rounding method. safe function ( value ) Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped. select function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. selectattr function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. slice function ( args, kwargs, b ) Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing three ul tags that represent columns. sort function ( environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func ) Sort an iterable using Python's :func: sorted . string builtin_function_or_method Convert an object to a string if it isn't already. This preserves a :class: Markup string rather than converting it back to a basic string, so it will still be marked as safe and won't be escaped again. striptags function ( value ) Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space. sum function ( args, kwargs, b ) Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter 'start' (which defaults to 0). When the sequence is empty it returns start. title function ( s ) Return a titlecased version of the value. I.e. words will start with uppercase letters, all remaining characters are lowercase. trim function ( value, chars ) Strip leading and trailing characters, by default whitespace. truncate function ( env, s, length, killwords, end, leeway, result ) Return a truncated copy of the string. The length is specified with the first parameter which defaults to 255 . If the second parameter is true the filter will cut the text at length. Otherwise it will discard the last word. If the text was in fact truncated it will append an ellipsis sign ( \"...\" ). If you want a different ellipsis sign than \"...\" you can specify it using the third parameter. Strings that only exceed the length by the tolerance margin given in the fourth parameter will not be truncated. unique function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute, getter, seen, item, key ) Returns a list of unique items from the given iterable. upper function ( s ) Convert a value to uppercase. urlencode function ( value, items ) Quote data for use in a URL path or query using UTF-8. urlize function ( eval_ctx, value, trim_url_limit, nofollow, target, rel, extra_schemes, policies, rel_parts, scheme, rv ) Convert URLs in text into clickable links. wordcount function ( s ) Count the words in that string. wordwrap function ( environment, s, width, break_long_words, wrapstring, break_on_hyphens ) Wrap a string to the given width. Existing newlines are treated as paragraphs to be wrapped separately. xmlattr function ( eval_ctx, d, autospace, rv ) Create an SGML/XML attribute string based on the items in a dict. All values that are neither none nor undefined are automatically escaped. tojson function ( eval_ctx, value, indent, policies, dumps, kwargs ) Serialize an object to a string of JSON, and mark it safe to render in HTML. This filter is only for use in HTML documents.","title":"Macros"},{"location":"macros/#macros","text":"","title":"Macros"},{"location":"macros/#macros-plugin-environment","text":"","title":"Macros Plugin Environment"},{"location":"macros/#general-list","text":"All available variables and filters within the macros plugin: Variable Type Content extra dict analytics [ dict ], seo [ dict ], social = [{'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/docker', 'link': 'https://www.docker.com/'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/github', 'link': 'https://github.com/docker'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/twitter', 'link': 'https://twitter.com/Docker'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/youtube', 'link': 'https://www.youtube.com/user/dockerrun'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/linkedin', 'link': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/docker'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/facebook', 'link': 'https://www.facebook.com/docker.run'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/slideshare', 'link': 'https://www.slideshare.net/docker'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/reddit-alien', 'link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/docker'}] config Config config_file_path = '/docs/mkdocs.yml', site_name = 'Docker Documentation', nav = [{'Home': 'index.md'}, {'Guides': [{'Docker overview': 'guides/docker-overview.md'}, {'Get Docker': 'guides/get-docker.md'}, {'Get Started': [{'Part 1: Getting started': 'guides/part1-getting-started.md'}, {'Part 2: Sample application': 'guides/part2-sample-application.md'}, {'Part 3: Update the application': 'guides/part3-update-the-application.md'}, {'Part 4: Share the application': 'guides/part4-share-the-application.md'}, {'Part 5: Persist the DB': 'guides/part5-persist-the-db.md'}, {'Part 6: Use bind mounts': 'guides/part6-use-bind-mounts.md'}, {'Part 7: Multi container apps': 'guides/part7-multi-container-apps.md'}, {'Part 8: Using compose': 'guides/part8-using-compose.md'}, {'Part 9: Image-building best practices': 'guides/part9-image-building-best-practices.md'}, {'Part 10: What next?': 'guides/part10-what-next.md'}]}]}, {'Manuals': [{'Docker Desktop': [{'Overview': 'manuals/desktop/overview.md'}]}]}, {'Reference': [{'Reference documentation': 'reference/index.md'}]}, {'Articles': 'https://www.docker.com/blog/'}], pages [ NoneType ], site_url = 'http://localhost:8124/', site_description [ NoneType ], site_author = 'Docker', theme [ Theme ], docs_dir = '/docs/docs', site_dir = '/tmp/site', copyright = 'Copyright \u00a9 2013-2021 Docker Inc.

See also the Jinja2 documentation on builtin filters ). Variable Type Content abs builtin_function_or_method Return the absolute value of the argument. attr function ( environment, obj, name, value ) Get an attribute of an object. foo|attr(\"bar\") works like foo.bar just that always an attribute is returned and items are not looked up. batch function ( value, linecount, fill_with, tmp, item ) A filter that batches items. It works pretty much like slice just the other way round. It returns a list of lists with the given number of items. If you provide a second parameter this is used to fill up missing items. See this example. capitalize function ( s ) Capitalize a value. The first character will be uppercase, all others lowercase. center function ( value, width ) Centers the value in a field of a given width. count builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. d function ( value, default_value, boolean ) If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value, otherwise the value of the variable. default function ( value, default_value, boolean ) If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value, otherwise the value of the variable. dictsort function ( value, case_sensitive, by, reverse, sort_func ) Sort a dict and yield (key, value) pairs. Python dicts may not be in the order you want to display them in, so sort them first. e builtin_function_or_method Replace the characters & , < , > , ' , and \" in the string with HTML-safe sequences. Use this if you need to display text that might contain such characters in HTML. escape builtin_function_or_method Replace the characters & , < , > , ' , and \" in the string with HTML-safe sequences. Use this if you need to display text that might contain such characters in HTML. filesizeformat function ( value, binary, bytes, base, prefixes, i, prefix, unit ) Format the value like a 'human-readable' file size (i.e. 13 kB, 4.1 MB, 102 Bytes, etc). Per default decimal prefixes are used (Mega, Giga, etc.), if the second parameter is set to True the binary prefixes are used (Mebi, Gibi). first function ( args, kwargs, b ) Return the first item of a sequence. float function ( value, default ) Convert the value into a floating point number. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0.0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. forceescape function ( value ) Enforce HTML escaping. This will probably double escape variables. format function ( value, args, kwargs ) Apply the given values to a printf-style _ format string, like string % values . groupby function ( args, kwargs, b ) Group a sequence of objects by an attribute using Python's :func: itertools.groupby . The attribute can use dot notation for nested access, like \"address.city\" . Unlike Python's groupby , the values are sorted first so only one group is returned for each unique value. indent function ( s, width, first, blank, newline, rv, lines ) Return a copy of the string with each line indented by 4 spaces. The first line and blank lines are not indented by default. int function ( value, default, base ) Convert the value into an integer. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. You can also override the default base (10) in the second parameter, which handles input with prefixes such as 0b, 0o and 0x for bases 2, 8 and 16 respectively. The base is ignored for decimal numbers and non-string values. join function ( args, kwargs, b ) Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the sequence. The separator between elements is an empty string per default, you can define it with the optional parameter. last function ( environment, seq ) Return the last item of a sequence. length builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. list function ( args, kwargs, b ) Convert the value into a list. If it was a string the returned list will be a list of characters. lower function ( s ) Convert a value to lowercase. map function ( args, kwargs, b ) Applies a filter on a sequence of objects or looks up an attribute. This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really only interested in a certain value of it. min function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the smallest item from the sequence. max function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the largest item from the sequence. pprint function ( value ) Pretty print a variable. Useful for debugging. random function ( context, seq ) Return a random item from the sequence. reject function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. rejectattr function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. replace function ( eval_ctx, s, old, new, count ) Return a copy of the value with all occurrences of a substring replaced with a new one. The first argument is the substring that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string. If the optional third argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. reverse function ( value, rv ) Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other way round. round function ( value, precision, method, func ) Round the number to a given precision. The first parameter specifies the precision (default is 0 ), the second the rounding method. safe function ( value ) Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped. select function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. selectattr function ( args, kwargs, b ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. slice function ( args, kwargs, b ) Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing three ul tags that represent columns. sort function ( environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func ) Sort an iterable using Python's :func: sorted . string builtin_function_or_method Convert an object to a string if it isn't already. This preserves a :class: Markup string rather than converting it back to a basic string, so it will still be marked as safe and won't be escaped again. striptags function ( value ) Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space. sum function ( args, kwargs, b ) Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter 'start' (which defaults to 0). When the sequence is empty it returns start. title function ( s ) Return a titlecased version of the value. I.e. words will start with uppercase letters, all remaining characters are lowercase. trim function ( value, chars ) Strip leading and trailing characters, by default whitespace. truncate function ( env, s, length, killwords, end, leeway, result ) Return a truncated copy of the string. The length is specified with the first parameter which defaults to 255 . If the second parameter is true the filter will cut the text at length. Otherwise it will discard the last word. If the text was in fact truncated it will append an ellipsis sign ( \"...\" ). If you want a different ellipsis sign than \"...\" you can specify it using the third parameter. Strings that only exceed the length by the tolerance margin given in the fourth parameter will not be truncated. unique function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute, getter, seen, item, key ) Returns a list of unique items from the given iterable. upper function ( s ) Convert a value to uppercase. urlencode function ( value, items ) Quote data for use in a URL path or query using UTF-8. urlize function ( eval_ctx, value, trim_url_limit, nofollow, target, rel, extra_schemes, policies, rel_parts, scheme, rv ) Convert URLs in text into clickable links. wordcount function ( s ) Count the words in that string. wordwrap function ( environment, s, width, break_long_words, wrapstring, break_on_hyphens ) Wrap a string to the given width. Existing newlines are treated as paragraphs to be wrapped separately. xmlattr function ( eval_ctx, d, autospace, rv ) Create an SGML/XML attribute string based on the items in a dict. All values that are neither none nor undefined are automatically escaped. tojson function ( eval_ctx, value, indent, policies, dumps, kwargs ) Serialize an object to a string of JSON, and mark it safe to render in HTML. This filter is only for use in HTML documents.","title":"Builtin Jinja2 Filters"},{"location":"tags/","text":"Tags \u00b6 Following is a list of relevant tags: [TAGS]","title":"Tags"},{"location":"tags/#tags","text":"Following is a list of relevant tags: [TAGS]","title":"Tags"},{"location":"guides/docker-overview/","text":"Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. The Docker platform \u00b6 Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way. Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers: Develop your application and its supporting components using containers. The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application. When you're ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service. This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two. What can I use Docker for? \u00b6 Fast, consistent delivery of your applications Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. Consider the following example scenario: Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues using Docker containers. They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and execute automated and manual tests. When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment and redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation. When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as pushing the updated image to the production environment. Responsive deployment and scaling Docker's container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer's local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments. Docker's portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in near real time. Running more workloads on the same hardware Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your compute capacity to achieve your business goals. Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments where you need to do more with fewer resources. Docker architecture \u00b6 Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon , which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers. The Docker daemon \u00b6 The Docker daemon ( dockerd ) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services. The Docker client \u00b6 The Docker client ( docker ) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run , the client sends these commands to dockerd , which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon. Docker registries \u00b6 A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry. When you use the docker pull or docker run commands, the required images are pulled from your configured registry. When you use the docker push command, your image is pushed to your configured registry. Docker objects \u00b6 When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects. Images \u00b6 An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ubuntu image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run. You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies. Containers \u00b6 A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state. By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine. You can control how isolated a container's network, storage, or other underlying subsystems are from other containers or from the host machine. A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to its state that are not stored in persistent storage disappear. Example docker run command \u00b6 The following command runs an ubuntu container, attaches interactively to your local command-line session, and runs /bin/bash . docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash When you run this command, the following happens (assuming you are using the default registry configuration): If you do not have the ubuntu image locally, Docker pulls it from your configured registry, as though you had run docker pull ubuntu manually. Docker creates a new container, as though you had run a docker container create command manually. Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container, as its final layer. This allows a running container to create or modify files and directories in its local filesystem. Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network, since you did not specify any networking options. This includes assigning an IP address to the container. By default, containers can connect to external networks using the host machine's network connection. Docker starts the container and executes /bin/bash . Because the container is running interactively and attached to your terminal (due to the -i and -t flags), you can provide input using your keyboard while the output is logged to your terminal. When you type exit to terminate the /bin/bash command, the container stops but is not removed. You can start it again or remove it. The underlying technology \u00b6 Docker is written in the Go programming language and takes advantage of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality. Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container . When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container. These namespaces provide a layer of isolation. Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace. Next steps \u00b6 Read about installing Docker .

This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two.","title":"The Docker platform"},{"location":"guides/docker-overview/#what-can-i-use-docker-for","text":"Fast, consistent delivery of your applications Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. Consider the following example scenario: Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues using Docker containers. They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and execute automated and manual tests. When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment and redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation. When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as pushing the updated image to the production environment. Responsive deployment and scaling Docker's container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer's local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments. Docker's portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in near real time. Running more workloads on the same hardware Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your compute capacity to achieve your business goals. Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments where you need to do more with fewer resources.","title":"What can I use Docker for?"},{"location":"guides/docker-overview/#docker-architecture","text":"Docker uses a client-server architecture.

With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker\u2019s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. You can download and install Docker on multiple platforms. Refer to the following section and choose the best installation path for you.

We are excited that you want to learn Docker. This page contains step-by-step instructions on how to get started with Docker. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to: Build and run an image as a container Share images using Docker Hub Deploy Docker applications using multiple containers with a database Running applications using Docker Compose In addition, you'll also learn about the best practices for building images, including instructions on how to scan your images for security vulnerabilities. If you are looking for information on how to containerize an application using your favorite language, see Language-specific getting started guides . We also recommend the video walkthrough from DockerCon 2020. Download and install Docker \u00b6 This tutorial assumes you have a current version of Docker installed on your machine. If you do not have Docker installed, choose your preferred operating system below to download Docker: Mac with Intel chip Mac with Apple chip Windows Linux Note For Docker Desktop installation instructions, see Install Docker Desktop on Mac and Install Docker Desktop on Windows . By downloading Docker Desktop, you agree to the terms of the Docker Software End User License Agreement and the Docker Data Processing Agreement . Start the tutorial \u00b6 If you've already run the command to get started with the tutorial, congratulations! If not, open a command prompt or bash window, and run the command: docker run -d -p \"80:80\" docker/getting-started You'll notice a few flags being used. Here's some more info on them: -d - run the container in detached mode (in the background) -p \"80:80\" - map port 80 of the host to port 80 in the container docker/getting-started - the image to use Tip You can combine single character flags to shorten the full command. As an example, the command above could be written as: docker run -dp \"80:80\" docker/getting-started The Docker Dashboard \u00b6 Before going too far, we want to highlight the Docker Dashboard, which gives you a quick view of the containers running on your machine. The Docker Dashboard is available for Mac and Windows. It gives you quick access to container logs, lets you get a shell inside the container, and lets you easily manage container lifecycle (stop, remove, etc.). To access the dashboard, follow the instructions for either Mac or Windows . If you open the dashboard now, you will see this tutorial running! The container name ( jolly_bouman below) is a randomly created name. So, you'll most likely have a different name. What is a container? \u00b6 Now that you've run a container, what is a container? Simply put, a container is simply another process on your machine that has been isolated from all other processes on the host machine. That isolation leverages kernel namespaces and cgroups , features that have been in Linux for a long time. Docker has worked to make these capabilities approachable and easy to use. Creating containers from scratch If you'd like to see how containers are built from scratch, Liz Rice from Aqua Security has a fantastic talk in which she creates a container from scratch in Go. While she makes a simple container, this talk doesn't go into networking, using images for the filesystem, and more. But, it gives a fantastic deep dive into how things are working. What is a container image? \u00b6 When running a container, it uses an isolated filesystem. This custom filesystem is provided by a container image . Since the image contains the container's filesystem, it must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configuration, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configuration for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata. We'll dive deeper into images later on, covering topics such as layering, best practices, and more. Info If you're familiar with chroot , think of a container as an extended version of chroot . The filesystem is simply coming from the image. But, a container adds additional isolation not available when simply using chroot.

If you're not familiar with Node.js, don't worry. No real JavaScript experience is needed. At this point, your development team is quite small and you're simply building an app to prove out your MVP (minimum viable product). You want to show how it works and what it's capable of doing without needing to think about how it will work for a large team, multiple developers, etc. Get the app \u00b6 Before we can run the application, we need to get the application source code onto our machine. For real projects, you will typically clone the repo. But, for this tutorial, we have created a ZIP file containing the application. Download the App contents . You can either pull the entire project or download it as a zip and extract the app folder out to get started with Once extracted, use your favorite code editor to open the project. If you're in need of an editor, you can use Visual Studio Code . You should see the package.json and two subdirectories ( src and spec ). Build the app's container image \u00b6 In order to build the application, we need to use a Dockerfile . A Dockerfile is simply a text-based script of instructions that is used to create a container image. If you've created Dockerfiles before, you might see a few flaws in the Dockerfile below. But, don't worry. We'll go over them. Create a file named Dockerfile in the same folder as the file package.json with the following contents. # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1 FROM node:12-alpine RUN apk add --no-cache python g++ make WORKDIR /app COPY . . RUN yarn install --production CMD [ \"node\" , \"src/index.js\" ] Please check that the file Dockerfile has no file extension like .txt . Some editors may append this file extension automatically and this would result in an error in the next step. If you haven't already done so, open a terminal and go to the app directory with the Dockerfile . Now build the container image using the docker build command. docker build -t getting-started . This command used the Dockerfile to build a new container image. You might have noticed that a lot of \"layers\" were downloaded. This is because we instructed the builder that we wanted to start from the node:12-alpine image. But, since we didn't have that on our machine, that image needed to be downloaded. After the image was downloaded, we copied in our application and used yarn to install our application's dependencies. The CMD directive specifies the default command to run when starting a container from this image. Finally, the -t flag tags our image.

Why is this? Let's dive into how the container is working. The container's filesystem \u00b6 When a container runs, it uses the various layers from an image for its filesystem. Each container also gets its own \"scratch space\" to create/update/remove files. Any changes won't be seen in another container, even if they are using the same image. See this in practice \u00b6 To see this in action, we're going to start two containers and create a file in each. What you'll see is that the files created in one container aren't available in another. Start an ubuntu container that will create a file named /data.txt with a random number between 1 and 10000. docker run -d ubuntu bash -c \"shuf -i 1-10000 -n 1 -o /data.txt && tail -f /dev/null\" In case you're curious about the command, we're starting a bash shell and invoking two commands (why we have the && ). The first portion picks a single random number and writes it to /data.txt . The second command is simply watching a file to keep the container running. Validate we can see the output by exec ing into the container. To do so, open the Dashboard and click the first action of the container that is running the ubuntu image. You will see a terminal that is running a shell in the ubuntu container. Run the following command to see the content of the /data.txt file. Close this terminal afterwards again. cat /data.txt If you prefer the command line you can use the docker exec command to do the same. You need to get the container's ID (use docker ps to get it) and get the content with the following command. docker exec <container-id> cat /data.txt You should see a random number! Now, let's start another ubuntu container (the same image) and we'll see we don't have the same file. docker run -it ubuntu ls / And look! There's no data.txt file there! That's because it was written to the scratch space for only the first container. Go ahead and remove the first container using the docker rm -f <container-id> command. Container volumes \u00b6 With the previous experiment, we saw that each container starts from the image definition each time it starts. While containers can create, update, and delete files, those changes are lost when the container is removed and all changes are isolated to that container. With volumes, we can change all of this. Volumes provide the ability to connect specific filesystem paths of the container back to the host machine. If a directory in the container is mounted, changes in that directory are also seen on the host machine. If we mount that same directory across container restarts, we'd see the same files. There are two main types of volumes. We will eventually use both, but we will start with named volumes . Persist the todo data \u00b6 By default, the todo app stores its data in a SQLite Database at /etc/todos/todo.db . If you're not familiar with SQLite, no worries! It's simply a relational database in which all of the data is stored in a single file. While this isn't the best for large-scale applications, it works for small demos. We'll talk about switching this to a different database engine later. With the database being a single file, if we can persist that file on the host and make it available to the next container, it should be able to pick up where the last one left off. By creating a volume and attaching (often called \"mounting\") it to the directory the data is stored in, we can persist the data. As our container writes to the todo.db file, it will be persisted to the host in the volume. As mentioned, we are going to use a named volume . Think of a named volume as simply a bucket of data. Docker maintains the physical location on the disk and you only need to remember the name of the volume. Every time you use the volume, Docker will make sure the correct data is provided. Create a volume by using the docker volume create command. docker volume create todo-db Stop and remove the todo app container once again in the Dashboard (or with docker rm -f <id> ), as it is still running without using the persistent volume. Start the todo app container, but add the -v flag to specify a volume mount. We will use the named volume and mount it to /etc/todos , which will capture all files created at the path. docker run -dp \"3000:3000\" -v todo-db:/etc/todos getting-started Once the container starts up, open the app and add a few items to your todo list. Stop and remove the container for the todo app. Use the Dashboard or docker ps to get the ID and then docker rm -f <id> to remove it. Start a new container using the same command from above. Open the app. You should see your items still in your list! Go ahead and remove the container when you're done checking out your list. Hooray! You've now learned how to persist data! Note While named volumes and bind mounts (which we'll talk about in a minute) are the two main types of volumes supported by a default Docker engine installation, there are many volume driver plugins available to support NFS, SFTP, NetApp, and more! This will be especially important once you start running containers on multiple hosts in a clustered environment with Swarm, Kubernetes, etc. Dive into the volume \u00b6 A lot of people frequently ask \"Where is Docker actually storing my data when I use a named volume?\" If you want to know, you can use the docker volume inspect command. $ docker volume inspect todo-db [ { \"CreatedAt\" : \"2019-09-26T02:18:36Z\" , \"Driver\" : \"local\" , \"Labels\" : {} , \"Mountpoint\" : \"/var/lib/docker/volumes/todo-db/_data\" , \"Name\" : \"todo-db\" , \"Options\" : {} , \"Scope\" : \"local\" } ] The Mountpoint is the actual location on the disk where the data is stored. Note that on most machines, you will need to have root access to access this directory from the host. But, that's where it is! Accessing volume data directly on Docker Desktop While running in Docker Desktop, the Docker commands are actually running inside a small VM on your machine. If you wanted to look at the actual contents of the Mountpoint directory, you would need to first get inside of the VM. Recap \u00b6 At this point, we have a functioning application that can survive restarts! We can show it off to our investors and hope they can catch our vision! However, we saw earlier that rebuilding images for every change takes quite a bit of time. There's got to be a better way to make changes, right?

Named volumes are great if we simply want to store data, as we don't have to worry about where the data is stored. With bind mounts , we control the exact mountpoint on the host. We can use this to persist data, but it's often used to provide additional data into containers. When working on an application, we can use a bind mount to mount our source code into the container to let it see code changes, respond, and let us see the changes right away. For Node-based applications, nodemon is a great tool to watch for file changes and then restart the application. There are equivalent tools in most other languages and frameworks. Quick volume type comparisons \u00b6 Bind mounts and named volumes are the two main types of volumes that come with the Docker engine.

We'll talk about that next!","title":"Recap"},{"location":"guides/part7-multi-container-apps/","text":"Up to this point, we have been working with single container apps. But, we now want to add MySQL to the application stack. The following question often arises: \"Where will MySQL run? Install it in the same container or run it separately?\" In general, each container should do one thing and do it well. A few reasons: There's a good chance you'd have to scale APIs and front-ends differently than databases Separate containers let you version and update versions in isolation While you may use a container for the database locally, you may want to use a managed service for the database in production. You don't want to ship your database engine with your app then. Running multiple processes will require a process manager (the container only starts one process), which adds complexity to container startup/shutdown And there are more reasons. So, we will update our application to work like this: Container networking \u00b6 Remember that containers, by default, run in isolation and don't know anything about other processes or containers on the same machine. So, how do we allow one container to talk to another? The answer is networking . Now, you don't have to be a network engineer (hooray!). Simply remember this rule... Note If two containers are on the same network, they can talk to each other. If they aren't, they can't. Start MySQL \u00b6 There are two ways to put a container on a network: 1) Assign it at start or 2) connect an existing container. For now, we will create the network first and attach the MySQL container at startup. Create the network. docker network create todo-app Start a MySQL container and attach it to the network. We're also going to define a few environment variables that the database will use to initialize the database (see the \"Environment Variables\" section in the MySQL Docker Hub listing ). docker run -d \\ --network todo-app --network-alias mysql \\ -v todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \\ -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD = secret \\ -e MYSQL_DATABASE = todos \\ mysql:5.7 If you are using PowerShell then use this command. docker run -d ` - -network todo-app - -network-alias mysql ` -v todo-mysql-data :/ var / lib / mysql ` -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD = secret ` -e MYSQL_DATABASE = todos ` mysql : 5 . 7 You'll also see we specified the --network-alias flag. We'll come back to that in just a moment. Tip You'll notice we're using a volume named todo-mysql-data here and mounting it at /var/lib/mysql , which is where MySQL stores its data. However, we never ran a docker volume create command. Docker recognizes we want to use a named volume and creates one automatically for us. To confirm we have the database up and running, connect to the database and verify it connects. docker exec -it <mysql-container-id> mysql -u root -p When the password prompt comes up, type in secret .

We have our todos database and it's ready for us to use! Connect to MySQL \u00b6 Now that we know MySQL is up and running, let's use it! But, the question is... how? If we run another container on the same network, how do we find the container (remember each container has its own IP address)?

Start a new container using the nicolaka/netshoot image. Make sure to connect it to the same network. docker run -it --network todo-app nicolaka/netshoot Inside the container, we're going to use the dig command, which is a useful DNS tool.

Run your app with MySQL \u00b6 The todo app supports the setting of a few environment variables to specify MySQL connection settings.

Diogo Monica, the former lead of security at Docker, wrote a fantastic blog post explaining why. A more secure mechanism is to use the secret support provided by your container orchestration framework. In most cases, these secrets are mounted as files in the running container. You'll see many apps (including the MySQL image and the todo app) also support env vars with a _FILE suffix to point to a file containing the variable. As an example, setting the MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE var will cause the app to use the contents of the referenced file as the connection password. Docker doesn't do anything to support these env vars. Your app will need to know to look for the variable and get the file contents. With all of that explained, let's start our dev-ready container!

With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down. The big advantage of using Compose is you can define your application stack in a file, keep it at the root of your project repo (it's now version controlled), and easily enable someone else to contribute to your project. Someone would only need to clone your repo and start the compose app. In fact, you might see quite a few projects on GitHub/GitLab doing exactly this now. So, how do we get started? Install Docker Compose \u00b6 If you installed Docker Desktop/Toolbox for either Windows or Mac, you already have Docker Compose! Play-with-Docker instances already have Docker Compose installed as well. If you are on a Linux machine, you will need to install Docker Compose . After installation, you should be able to run the following and see version information. docker-compose version Create the Compose file \u00b6 At the root of the app project, create a file named docker-compose.yml . In the compose file, we'll start off by defining the schema version. In most cases, it's best to use the latest supported version. You can look at the Compose file reference for the current schema versions and the compatibility matrix. version : \"3.7\" Next, we'll define the list of services (or containers) we want to run as part of our application. version : \"3.7\" services : And now, we'll start migrating a service at a time into the compose file. Define the app service \u00b6 To remember, this was the command we were using to define our app container. docker run -dp 3000 :3000 \\ -w /app -v \" $( pwd ) :/app\" \\ --network todo-app \\ -e MYSQL_HOST = mysql \\ -e MYSQL_USER = root \\ -e MYSQL_PASSWORD = secret \\ -e MYSQL_DB = todos \\ node:12-alpine \\ sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\" If you are using PowerShell then use this command. docker run -dp 3000 : 3000 ` -w / app -v \" $( pwd ) :/app\" ` - -network todo-app ` -e MYSQL_HOST = mysql ` -e MYSQL_USER = root ` -e MYSQL_PASSWORD = secret ` -e MYSQL_DB = todos ` node : 12-alpine ` sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\" First, let's define the service entry and the image for the container. We can pick any name for the service. The name will automatically become a network alias, which will be useful when defining our MySQL service. version : \"3.7\" services : app : image : node:12-alpine Typically, you will see the command close to the image definition, although there is no requirement on ordering. So, let's go ahead and move that into our file. version : \"3.7\" services : app : image : node:12-alpine command : sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\" Let's migrate the -p 3000:3000 part of the command by defining the ports for the service. We will use the short syntax here, but there is also a more verbose long syntax available as well. version : \"3.7\" services : app : image : node:12-alpine command : sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\" ports : - 3000:3000 Next, we'll migrate both the working directory ( -w /app ) and the volume mapping ( -v \"$(pwd):/app\" ) by using the working_dir and volumes definitions. Volumes also has a short and long syntax. One advantage of Docker Compose volume definitions is we can use relative paths from the current directory. version : \"3.7\" services : app : image : node:12-alpine command : sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\" ports : - 3000:3000 working_dir : /app volumes : - ./:/app Finally, we need to migrate the environment variable definitions using the environment key. version : \"3.7\" services : app : image : node:12-alpine command : sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\" ports : - 3000:3000 working_dir : /app volumes : - ./:/app environment : MYSQL_HOST : mysql MYSQL_USER : root MYSQL_PASSWORD : secret MYSQL_DB : todos Define the MySQL service \u00b6 Now, it's time to define the MySQL service. The command that we used for that container was the following: docker run -d \\ --network todo-app --network-alias mysql \\ -v todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \\ -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD = secret \\ -e MYSQL_DATABASE = todos \\ mysql:5.7 If you are using PowerShell then use this command. docker run -d ` - -network todo-app - -network-alias mysql ` -v todo-mysql-data :/ var / lib / mysql ` -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD = secret ` -e MYSQL_DATABASE = todos ` mysql : 5 . 7 We will first define the new service and name it mysql so it automatically gets the network alias. We'll go ahead and specify the image to use as well. version : \"3.7\" services : app : # The app service definition mysql : image : mysql:5.7 Next, we'll define the volume mapping. When we ran the container with docker run , the named volume was created automatically. However, that doesn't happen when running with Compose. We need to define the volume in the top-level volumes: section and then specify the mountpoint in the service config. By simply providing only the volume name, the default options are used. There are many more options available though. version : \"3.7\" services : app : # The app service definition mysql : image : mysql:5.7 volumes : - todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql volumes : todo-mysql-data : Finally, we only need to specify the environment variables. version : \"3.7\" services : app : # The app service definition mysql : image : mysql:5.7 volumes : - todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql environment : MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD : secret MYSQL_DATABASE : todos volumes : todo-mysql-data : At this point, our complete docker-compose.yml should look like this: version : \"3.7\" services : app : image : node:12-alpine command : sh -c \"yarn install && yarn run dev\" ports : - 3000:3000 working_dir : /app volumes : - ./:/app environment : MYSQL_HOST : mysql MYSQL_USER : root MYSQL_PASSWORD : secret MYSQL_DB : todos mysql : image : mysql:5.7 volumes : - todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql environment : MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD : secret MYSQL_DATABASE : todos volumes : todo-mysql-data : Run the application stack \u00b6 Now that we have our docker-compose.yml file, we can start it up! Make sure no other copies of the app/db are running first ( docker ps and docker rm -f <ids> ). Start up the application stack using the docker-compose up command. We'll add the -d flag to run everything in the background. docker-compose up -d When we run this, we should see output like this: Creating network \"app_default\" with the default driver Creating volume \"app_todo-mysql-data\" with default driver Creating app_app_1 ... done Creating app_mysql_1 ... done You'll notice that the volume was created as well as a network! By default, Docker Compose automatically creates a network specifically for the application stack (which is why we didn't define one in the compose file). Let's look at the logs using the docker-compose logs -f command. You'll see the logs from each of the services interleaved into a single stream. This is incredibly useful when you want to watch for timing-related issues. The -f flag \"follows\" the log, so will give you live output as it's generated. If you have run the command already, you'll see output that looks like this: mysql_1 | 2019-10-03T03:07:16.083639Z 0 [Note] mysqld: ready for connections. mysql_1 | Version: '5.7.27' socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' port: 3306 MySQL Community Server (GPL) app_1 | Connected to mysql db at host mysql app_1 | Listening on port 3000 The service name is displayed at the beginning of the line (often colored) to help distinguish messages. If you want to view the logs for a specific service, you can add the service name to the end of the logs command (for example, docker-compose logs -f app ). Waiting for the DB before starting the app When the app is starting up, it actually sits and waits for MySQL to be up and ready before trying to connect to it. Docker doesn't have any built-in support to wait for another container to be fully up, running, and ready before starting another container. For Node-based projects, you can use the wait-port dependency. Similar projects exist for other languages/frameworks. At this point, you should be able to open your app and see it running. And hey! We're down to a single command! See the app stack in Docker Dashboard \u00b6 If we look at the Docker Dashboard, we'll see that there is a group named app . This is the \"project name\" from Docker Compose and used to group the containers together. By default, the project name is simply the name of the directory that the docker-compose.yml was located in. If you twirl down the app, you will see the two containers we defined in the compose file. The names are also a little more descriptive, as they follow the pattern of <project-name>_<service-name>_<replica-number> . So, it's very easy to quickly see what container is our app and which container is the mysql database. Tear it all down \u00b6 When you're ready to tear it all down, simply run docker-compose down or hit the trash can on the Docker Dashboard for the entire app. The containers will stop and the network will be removed. Removing Volumes By default, named volumes in your compose file are NOT removed when running docker-compose down . If you want to remove the volumes, you will need to add the --volumes flag. The Docker Dashboard does not remove volumes when you delete the app stack. Once torn down, you can switch to another project, run docker-compose up and be ready to contribute to that project! It really doesn't get much simpler than that! Recap \u00b6 In this section, we learned about Docker Compose and how it helps us dramatically simplify the defining and sharing of multi-service applications. We created a Compose file by translating the commands we were using into the appropriate compose format. At this point, we're starting to wrap up the tutorial. However, there are a few best practices about image building we want to cover, as there is a big issue with the Dockerfile we've been using.

RUN yarn install --production CMD [ \"node\" , \"src/index.js\" ] Going back to the image history output, we see that each command in the Dockerfile becomes a new layer in the image. You might remember that when we made a change to the image, the yarn dependencies had to be reinstalled. Is there a way to fix this? It doesn't make much sense to ship around the same dependencies every time we build, right? To fix this, we need to restructure our Dockerfile to help support the caching of the dependencies. For Node-based applications, those dependencies are defined in the package.json file. So, what if we copied only that file in first, install the dependencies, and then copy in everything else? Then, we only recreate the yarn dependencies if there was a change to the package.json . Make sense? Update the Dockerfile to copy in the package.json first, install dependencies, and then copy everything else in. # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1 FROM node:12-alpine WORKDIR /app COPY package.json yarn.lock ./ RUN yarn install --production COPY . . CMD [ \"node\" , \"src/index.js\" ] Create a file named .dockerignore in the same folder as the Dockerfile with the following contents. node_modules .dockerignore files are an easy way to selectively copy only image relevant files.

And, you'll see that steps 1-4 all have Using cache . So, hooray! We're using the build cache. Pushing and pulling this image and updates to it will be much faster as well. Hooray! Multi-stage builds \u00b6 While we're not going to dive into it too much in this tutorial, multi-stage builds are an incredibly powerful tool to help use multiple stages to create an image. There are several advantages for them: Separate build-time dependencies from runtime dependencies Reduce overall image size by shipping only what your app needs to run Maven/Tomcat example \u00b6 When building Java-based applications, a JDK is needed to compile the source code to Java bytecode. However, that JDK isn't needed in production. Also, you might be using tools like Maven or Gradle to help build the app. Those also aren't needed in our final image. Multi-stage builds help. # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1 FROM maven AS build WORKDIR /app COPY . . RUN mvn package FROM tomcat COPY --from = build /app/target/file.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps In this example, we use one stage (called build ) to perform the actual Java build using Maven. In the second stage (starting at FROM tomcat ), we copy in files from the build stage. The final image is only the last stage being created (which can be overridden using the --target flag). React example \u00b6 When building React applications, we need a Node environment to compile the JS code (typically JSX), SASS stylesheets, and more into static HTML, JS, and CSS. If we aren't doing server-side rendering, we don't even need a Node environment for our production build. Why not ship the static resources in a static nginx container? # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1 FROM node:12 AS build WORKDIR /app COPY package* yarn.lock ./ RUN yarn install COPY public ./public COPY src ./src RUN yarn run build FROM nginx:alpine COPY --from = build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html Here, we are using a node:12 image to perform the build (maximizing layer caching) and then copying the output into an nginx container. Cool, huh? Recap \u00b6 By understanding a little bit about how images are structured, we can build images faster and ship fewer changes. Scanning images gives us confidence that the containers we are running and distributing are secure. Multi-stage builds also help us reduce overall image size and increase final container security by separating build-time dependencies from runtime dependencies.","title":"Part 9: Image-building best practices"},{"location":"guides/part9-image-building-best-practices/#security-scanning","text":"When you have built an image, it is good practice to scan it for security vulnerabilities using the docker scan command.
